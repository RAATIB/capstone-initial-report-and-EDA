## Introduction and Problem Statement:
In this project, we utilized data processing tools and a machine learning model to determine whether certain aspects of a track on Spotify, like "energy" and "danceability", could predict how commercially successful that song would be on Spotify.

Our analysis provided ***useful information for artists and their companies, indicating which features may contribute to a song's success and to what degree.***

Our analysis was specified to include only numeric features of a song, like a score for "energy", or a song's key signature and duration, for example.

Our conclusions lead us to **actionable steps for artists and company** to help secure commercial success in a competitive landscape, giving direction for producers and songwriters to **assess and predict which tracks can help them stand out to a crowd** and stay afloat in a market of constant innovation!


## Strongest Indicators of Success

### Danceability and Time signature (Positive indicators) vs. Speechiness (Negative Indicators)

* Our analysis indicates that a songs **danceability is a strong indicator of it's success. The more danceable a song is, the more likely it is to succeed.** Likewise, a higher time signature is more likely to succeed by a significant degree. In practice, after assessing the data, **this means a time signature of 4 will perform better than a time signature of 3** in terms of commercial success.
* On the other hand, **speechiness can be a large cause of detriment for a song. Artists should avoid sections of speech** in their music when gearing for virality or popularity.


## Moderate Indicators of Success

### Liveness and acousticness
* Our analysis shows promising information for live and acoustic tracks. **Liveness and acousticness both significantly contribute to a song's popularity, implying that audiences want live and acoustic versions of music.** This may imply that a more genuine or authentic spin on a song leads to success. It is not as strong of an indicator as danceability or time signature, though, so those should be prioritized when producing for popularity.


## Conclusion and Summary:
*Here, we'll summarize how numeric features of a song predict a song's success.*

* Strongest Positive Indicators: Danceability and a higher time signature are very strongly beneficial for a song's popularity.
* Strongest Negative Indicator: Speechiness tends to very strongly decline the popularity of a song.
* Moderate Positive Indicator: Liveness and acousticness are aspects that can decently improve the popularity of a song. Data tells artists that a live or acoustic Spotify version tends to succeed!
* Lack of Indication: Artists can rely on diverse tempo, key, mode, loudness, valence, instrumentalness, AND duration! These do not strongly affect the popularity of a song.
